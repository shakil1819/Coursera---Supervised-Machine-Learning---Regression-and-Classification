-   Linear regression with one feature was defined as fwb of x equals wx plus b.
-   Now with multiple features, the model is defined as fwb of x equals w1x1 plus w2x2 plus w3x3 plus w4x4 plus b.
-   X1, X2, X3, and X4 are used to represent the four features.
-   X subscript j represents the list of features, where j ranges from 1 to 4 because there are four features.
-   X superscript i represents the ith training example, where i is a list of four numbers or a vector of features.
-   X superscript i subscript j is the value of the jth feature in the ith training example.
-   One possible model for housing price prediction may estimate the price of the house as 0.1 times X1, 4 times X2, 10 times X3, -2 times X4, plus 80.
-   b equals 80 is the base price of a house without any features.
-   For each additional square foot, the price increases by 0.1 $1,000 or by $100.
-   For each additional bedroom, the price increases by $4,000.
-   For each additional floor, the price may increase by $10,000.
-   For each additional year of the house's age, the price may decrease by $2,000.
-   The model with n features is defined as fwb of x equals W.T * X + b, where W is a vector of parameters W1 through Wn, and X is a vector of features.
