Notes on Vectorization:

-   Vectorization is a useful idea in implementing learning algorithms that makes code shorter and runs more efficiently.
-   Vectorized code allows taking advantage of modern numerical linear algebra libraries and GPU hardware to execute code more quickly.
-   Vectorization means performing operations on an entire array of data, rather than looping through each element individually.
-   NumPy is a widely used numerical linear algebra library in Python and machine learning.
-   Vectorization can be demonstrated with an example of computing a model's prediction using parameters w and b and features x.
-   Without vectorization, the code would be inefficient for both the code and computer to compute.
-   A for loop can be used, but it's still not efficient and doesn't use vectorization.
-   The math expression of the function f, which is the dot product of w and x plus b, can be implemented with a single line of code using vectorization.
-   The NumPy dot function is a vectorized implementation of the dot product operation between two vectors and is much faster than previous implementations.
-   Vectorization has two distinct benefits: making code shorter and making it run much faster.
-   The ability of the NumPy dot function to use parallel hardware makes it much more efficient than the for loop or sequential calculation.
-   Vectorization is practical when n is large, as it saves time on typing and makes the code more computationally efficient.
