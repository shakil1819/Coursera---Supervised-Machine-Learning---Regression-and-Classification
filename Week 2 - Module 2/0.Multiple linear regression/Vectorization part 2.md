Notes on Vectorization and Machine Learning:

-   Vectorization is a technique used to make machine learning algorithms run faster by performing computations on multiple values in parallel.
-   Vectorization allows the computer to perform multiple calculations at the same time, which results in much faster calculations than codes without vectorization.
-   Vectorization is especially important when running algorithms on large data sets or training large models, which is often the case with machine learning.
-   Multiple linear regression is an example of how vectorization can be used to make computations more efficient.
-   With vectorization, all 16 values in the vector can be processed in parallel, resulting in much faster computation time than with a for-loop.
-   Using vectorized code, such as the NumPy function dot, can also run much faster than using a for-loop.
-   The optional lab on NumPy introduces new syntax and is useful for understanding how to work with data stored in NumPy arrays.
-   Vectorization is one of the most important and useful techniques for implementing machine learning algorithms.
-   The next video will put the math of multiple linear regression together with vectorization to influence gradient descent for multiple linear regression with vectorization.
