# Optional Lab: Feature scaling and learning rate

In this optional lab you can also take a look at how feature scaling is done in code and also see how different choices of the learning rate alpha can lead to better or worse training of your model. This will help you to gain a deeper intuition about feature scaling as well as the learning rate alpha.
