#points 
Key points:

-   The class teaches the state of the art in machine learning and provides hands-on practice in implementing algorithms.
-   Machine learning is widely used because it is difficult to write explicit programs for many interesting tasks, so machines need to learn how to do them on their own.
-   Machine learning has many applications across different industries and is estimated to create trillions of dollars in value by 2030.
-   There is a vast unfulfilled demand for machine learning skills.
-   The quest for artificial general intelligence is exciting but still a long way off.
-   The next video will provide a formal definition of machine learning and introduce different types of problems and algorithms.
