-   Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or pattern in the data.
-   Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning where the algorithm groups similar data points together.
-   Anomaly detection is another type of unsupervised learning used to detect unusual events, which is important for fraud detection and many other applications.
-   Dimensionality reduction is another type of unsupervised learning that compresses a large dataset to a smaller one while retaining most of the information.
-   Spam filtering and diagnosing diabetes are examples of supervised learning problems, while the news story example and market segmentation can be approached as unsupervised learning problems.
-   Jupyter Notebooks are a useful tool for machine learning.
