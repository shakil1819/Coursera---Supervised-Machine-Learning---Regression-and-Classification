Notes:

-   Supervised learning algorithm inputs a dataset.
-   Training set in supervised learning includes both input features and output targets.
-   To train the model, you feed the training set (input features and output targets) to your learning algorithm.
-   The output of the model is the prediction, which is written as y-hat.
-   The function f is called the model.
-   X is called the input or the input feature, and y is the target or the actual true value in the training set.
-   The function f can be represented as a math formula, such as a straight line, with the values of w and b determining the prediction y-hat based on the input feature x.
-   Linear regression is a linear model with one variable (univariate linear regression) that uses a straight line to make predictions for the value of y using a streamline function of x.
-   A cost function is used in linear regression and in training many of the most advanced AI models in the world.
