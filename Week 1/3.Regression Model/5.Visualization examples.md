#points 

Summary of the transcript:

-   The speaker presents different visualizations of w and b for linear regression.
-   One point on the graph j corresponds to one pair of values for w and b that use a particular cost j.
-   Different choices of w and b correspond to different lines f of x and different values for the cost j.
-   The better fit lines correspond to points on the graph of j that are closer to the minimum possible cost for this cost function j of w and b.
-   The speaker explains the optional lab that follows the video, where users can run some codes to see how the cost varies depending on how well the model fits the data.
-   The speaker ==introduces the algorithm called gradient descent==, which is used to automatically find the values of parameters w and b that give the best fit line and minimize the cost function j.
