-   The transcript talks about visualizing the cost function in a linear regression model.
-   The video shows the model's parameters w and b, the cost function J of w and b, as well as the goal of linear regression, which is to minimize the cost function J of w and b over parameters w and b.
-   There is a training set of house sizes and prices.
-   The cost function J of w and b is shown as a surface plot where the axes are labeled w and b. The cost function has a similar shape to a soup bowl in three dimensions.
-   Each single point on the surface of the cost function represents some particular choice of w and b.
-   There is another way of plotting the cost function J that is useful for visualization, which is a contour plot.
-   The contour plot shows ellipses or ovals that represent the center points on the 3D surface which are at the exact same height.
