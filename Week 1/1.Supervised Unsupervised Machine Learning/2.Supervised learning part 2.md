#points
-   Supervised learning algorithms learn to predict input-output or X to Y mapping
-   Regression algorithms learn to predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers
-   Classification algorithms learn to predict categories, which can be non-numeric or numeric but a small set of possible outputs
-   Classification problems can have more than two possible output categories
-   Input can be one or more values
-   The learning algorithm finds a boundary that separates the output categories
-   Supervised learning has two major types, regression and classification.
-   Unsupervised learning is another major type of machine learning.
