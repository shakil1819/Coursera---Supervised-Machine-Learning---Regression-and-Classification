Notes on Unsupervised Learning:

-   After supervised learning, unsupervised learning is the most widely used form of machine learning.
-   In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data that is not associated with any output labels y.
-   The goal is to find structure, patterns, or something interesting in the data without supervision.
-   An unsupervised learning algorithm might decide that the data can be assigned to different clusters, which is called a clustering algorithm.
-   Clustering is used in many applications, such as Google News, to group related stories together.
-   The clustering algorithm finds articles that mention similar words and groups them into clusters on its own without supervision.
-   Unsupervised learning can also be applied to clustering genetic or DNA data to group individuals into different categories.
-   Many companies have huge databases of customer information, and unsupervised learning can be used to automatically group customers into different market segments for efficient customer service.
