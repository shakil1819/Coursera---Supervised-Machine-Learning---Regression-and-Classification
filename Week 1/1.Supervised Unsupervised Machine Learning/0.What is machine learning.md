-   Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
-   Arthur Samuel is known for writing a checkers playing program that learned how to play the game by playing tens of thousands of games against itself.
-   The more opportunities you give a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform.
-   The two main types of machine learning are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
-   Supervised learning is the type of machine learning that is used most in many real-world applications and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation.
-   The first and second courses of the specialization focus on supervised learning, and the third focuses on unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.
-   Practical advice for applying learning algorithms is equally important to having great tools.
-   The class teaches the best practices for developing a practical, valuable machine learning system.
-   Supervised learning is when the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, and unsupervised learning is when the algorithm learns patterns and relationships in an unlabeled dataset.
-   Supervised learning is useful for prediction tasks, while unsupervised learning is useful for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
