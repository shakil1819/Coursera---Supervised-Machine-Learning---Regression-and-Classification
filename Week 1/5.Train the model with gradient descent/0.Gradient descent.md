| Points | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1      | Visualizations of the cost function j |
| 2      | Algorithm called gradient descent |
| 3      | Gradient descent applies to more general functions |
| 4      | Start off with some initial guesses for w and b |
| 5      | Keep on changing the parameters w and b to reduce the cost j of w, b |
| 6      | Some functions j may have more than one possible minimum |
| 7      | Gradient descent finds the direction of steepest descent |
| 8      | Repeat the process until you find yourself at the bottom of the valley |
| 9      | Gradient descent has an interesting property |
