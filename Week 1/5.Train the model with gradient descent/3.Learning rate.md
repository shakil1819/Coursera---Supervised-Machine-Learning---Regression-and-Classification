The transcript discusses the impact of the learning rate, alpha, on the efficiency of the implementation of gradient descent. It explains that choosing the learning rate carefully is crucial because if the learning rate is too small or too large, gradient descent may not work efficiently or may not converge at all.

The transcript breaks down the effect of the learning rate into two sections. The first section explains what happens when the learning rate is too small. In this case, the update for W will be a tiny, insignificant step, making the descent process incredibly slow. It may take many steps before the algorithm reaches the minimum, and even then, it may take longer than necessary. Therefore, gradient descent may work but will be too slow if the learning rate is too small.

The second section explains what happens when the learning rate is too large. In this case, the update for W will be a significant step, leading to overshooting of the minimum, leading to an increase in the cost J. With each update, the algorithm will keep moving further away from the minimum, eventually diverging and never converging. Therefore, gradient descent may fail to converge or even diverge if the learning rate is too large.

The transcript also discusses what happens when gradient descent reaches a local minimum, and the learning rate is fixed. If the current parameter is already at a local minimum, further steps of gradient descent do not change the parameter values since the derivative term is zero. In this case, the algorithm leaves the parameter values unchanged, which is desirable because it keeps the solution at the local minimum. This also explains how gradient descent can reach a local minimum even with a fixed learning rate.
